    <p>This is a website about bicycling. Mostly in Northern Virginia.
      And mostly about the Washington & Old Dominion trail.</p>

      <p>Looking for information on the trail like things to do, history, or events,
      <a href="https://www.novaparks.com/parks/washington-and-old-dominion-railroad-regional-park">NOVAPARKS</a> has you covered.</p>

      <p>Here, on these fantastical pages, we will write and share photos of the everyday and seasonal things you may not get on your
      average website.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Today on the trail</h3>
